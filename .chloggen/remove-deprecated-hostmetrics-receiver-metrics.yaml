  The metrics `process.memory.physical_usage` and `process.memory.virtual_usage` have been deprecated since v0.64.0.
  They are now being removed. You should use the following metrics instead: `process.memory.usage`, `process.memory.virtual`.
  For details, see the [docs](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/v0.71.0/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver#transition-to-process-memory-metric-names-aligned-with-opentelemetry-specification).
